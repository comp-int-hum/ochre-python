Authors developed a variety of tropes to signal properties like race, economic status, masculinity, and so forth, but these could easily become detached from reality, or confused by unintended correlations, and owe more to intertextuality than observation of speakers.  To explore this mosaic, we are developing a machine learning approach to recognizing and matching orthographic variants with their canonical form, incorporating insights from large language models and metric learning.",

But in the purely descriptive view, a grammar is essentially the reification of a particular analytic process: while interesting and useful in many scenarios, it has limited ability to directly add insight.  We are considering the use of \"Adaptor Grammars\", a non-parametric extension of context-free grammars, to minimally specify the structure that (basically) all readers agree on, and allow the machine learning process to choose additional structure based on its information-theoretic objectives.  If and how this structure aligns with human intuitions (about e.g. rhyme, scansion) is the underlying question.",

Working in Istanbul during World War 2, his direct access to sources was constrained, and of course he lacked the computational mechanisms that would be particularly helpful for such a temporally wide-ranging study.  We are constructing a general Latin corpus, additionally annotated for whether Auerbach had access to each document.  By performing unsupervised semantic learning and supervised syntactic parsing over the corpus, we hope to better understand how constraints affected Auerbach's scholarship, how his conclusions generalize, and to expand his hypotheses and consider the broad class of potential syntactic and semantic shifts in Latin from the early Republic through the Middle Ages.",
