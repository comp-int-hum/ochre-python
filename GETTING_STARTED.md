# Getting started

This tutorial is aimed for OCHRE *users*, i.e. those interested in using the client-side of the ecosystem to apply computational methods to their scholarly domain.  All commands are presented in their entirety, but heterogeneous environments will inevitably require minor adjustments, so some familiarity with the command line or Python may be useful.  We will cover the steps for setting up a simple OCHRE user environment and connecting to an existing server.

## A text editor and the command line

These are the two fundamental 

Using OCHRE involves working on the *command line*, or *terminal*, so let's start by opening a new terminal.

## Python

OCHRE is written in Python, so the first step is to ensure you have a reasonably up-to-date version of Python installed.  If you are on a Mac that has the `brew` command, simply run:

```
brew install python
```

Otherwise, browse to [the Python downloads page](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and select the version for your operating system and follow the installation instructions.
